## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Became more familair with using grids, specifically Areas for layout.
- Began employing the system of defining a font size under HTML and then using ems of this.
- Also used vars for colors for the first time
- Attempted to comment my styles for better comprehensibility
- Used Semantic markup more consciously


### Continued development

- Need to become more confident with flexbox, specifically regarding scaling up and down. I'm setting specific pixel max widths on items at the moment and I suspect there is a more organic method.
- Would also like to be able to define sizes/limits using calc, but it still haven't wrapped my head around how to do it sensibly.

### Useful resources

-CSS tricks was a useful resource for understanding grids better.
-The Perfect Pixel Chrome extension made life a lot easier re: matching up to the reference screenshots
